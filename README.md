# Account_intelligence_Test
Account Intelligence test for RedHat

This project should be pretty straight forward, clone the repo into your own virtualenvironment, install the dependencies in the requirements.txt and change the DB in the config and you should be good to go.

I alsowant to say that I didn't structure the project in a typical mvc fashion. If I was going to expand on this project, I'd add directories for the model, the app, the tests and the business logic to give it more structure. I also forgot to add the csvs to the .gitignore I hope that's not a big deal.
